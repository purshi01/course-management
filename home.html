  <h2 class="w3-wide">ONLINE FREE COURSES</h2>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>"We created this page because we want to see the better world"</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify">"One of the best advantages of online classes is flexibility. A student can usually take the course any time during the day or week. While there are custom essay writing and researching assignments to complete, the precise time to take the class often depends on the student's desire. Students who work are able to take the class based on their schedules. Many students work on their course during the middle of the night or early in the morning. The flexibility of the course makes it possible for a person to complete the course, while attending college courses in person might be impossible due to their work schedules.

Another great advantage of online courses is that almost any type of course can be found online. Distance learning courses are often available from a number of colleges. A person can simply use the Google to find a class.

While most people believe a disadvantage of taking online courses is that the students cannot have access to a faculty member, the fact is that many online courses offer a greater access to faculty. Shy students are able to ask questions because they can ask them online without facing the instructor. The Internet makes it possible for the student to ask questions and receive the answer back almost immediately.

Online courses are convenient for most undergraduate and graduate students who can study when they want and they can finish writing or researching assignments based on their own person schedules. The fact is -- online courses offer flexibility and convenience that are often vital to students who work and have families.

While online courses have advantages, they also have disadvantages. One of the disadvantages with online courses is they are often more expensive than regular classes. Is it worth the cost to take the class? This is an individual question that often depends on the student taking the class.

Another disadvantage of online courses is the complete lack of supervision. If a person is not motivated to finish what they start, then it is probably not a good idea to take an online course. While there may be deadlines and expectations from the online course instructor, there is no one there to remind him/her to do the assignments or to take the tests.

A student who does not have Internet skills cannot expect to do well with an online course. A student taking an online course must have access to a computer. These are two requirements that need to be considered before taking an online course."</p>
